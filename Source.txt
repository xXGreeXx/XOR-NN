INFO
To begin enter 2 values (either 0 or 1) and the network will process this information and output the XOR value of these two inputs

SPECIF
Network Topology: 2 x 2 x 1: 6 weights and 3 biases
Registers 0-8 will hold these nine values
Registers 9 and 10 will hold the two user inputs
Registers 11 and 12 will hold the weighted sums of the two hidden neurons
Register 13 will hold the final network output
Registers 13-30 are working registers use for in data processing

-PROGRAM-START-

TAKE USER INPUT AND PUT IT IN #10 and #11
>>>>>>>>> Step past weight data into input registers
, > Accept input A and step to next register
,  Accept input B
